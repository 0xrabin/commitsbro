# Lots of commits bro

# Noice



# Its done guys.
The work is complete.

On next refresh I should be in top in commits.top/nepal.html if everything goes right

Update:
Okay it did not quite work as expected. It showed ~7k contributions instead of 130k 
Sad times :(

Second Update:
So what happened was the site updated when I had 7k contribs and now upon reupdate I have arised to the top with 140k commits.
